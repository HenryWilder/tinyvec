# Tinyvc

Tinyvec is a minimized language for encoding SVG data using a tiny number of symbols.

It was designed for the idea of communicating through a hieroglyphic form of noun-representative images.

Each symbol can represent an entire concept, and the language strives to be small enough to use as words representing images; behind the scenes.
